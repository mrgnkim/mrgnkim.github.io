<h1>Morgan Kimathi</h1>

<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p><i>My name is Morgan Kimathi and I'm from Silver Spring, Maryland. I went to Springbrook High School and ran track & field during my freshman and senior year. 
    My favorite events were the 200m, 4x100m, and 4x200m relay.
    My hobbies include running, biking, working out, playing video games, and listening to a lot of music on a daily basis.
    My favorite artists at the moment include Travis Scott, Solange, LUCKI, SZA, Lana Del Rey, and a few more. 
    I came to RIT because my friend had told me about it freshman year and after coming to the school for a few in person tours I decided that this was the right place to go plus they have a very good SE program  which had me interested.
